                <h3>Cake</h3>
                <p>Cake is a form of sweet food made from flour, sugar, and other ingredients, that is usually baked. In their oldest forms, cakes were modifications of bread, but cakes now cover a wide range of preparations that can be simple or elaborate, and that share features with other desserts such as pastries, meringues, custards, and pies.</p>

                <h3>Soup</h3>
                <p>Soup is a primarily liquid food, generally served warm or hot (but may be cool or cold), that is made by combining ingredients of meat or vegetables with stock, milk, or water. Hot soups are additionally characterized by boiling solid ingredients in liquids in a pot until the flavors are extracted, forming a broth.</p>

                <h3>Meat Fry</h3>
                <p>Beef recipes are not something that one normally associates with India. Rightly too, it is hard to find beef in most states of India, and in some places, the sale and consumption of beef might even be illegal. There is one state that defies this norm – my beloved Kerala. We love cows and everything about them – milk, leather, and beef.</p>
